# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction
In this project developed in Java we use decision trees to predict the survival value of each passenger of their respective class. There is a dataset to train the model and another to test it. This project is focused on the use of maps to store the information

In order to run the program, the filePaths on the DAO and the testDataSet class should be updated.
